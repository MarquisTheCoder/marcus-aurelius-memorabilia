  Marcus Aurelius was the last of the Five Good Emperors of Rome. 
  His reign (161â€“180 CE) marked the end of a period of internal tranquility and good government. 
  After his death the empire quickly descended 
  into civil war. He has symbolized the Golden Age of the Roman Empire for many generations in the West.
