  Marcus Aurelius was the last of the Five Good Emperors of Rome. 
  His reign (161â€“180 CE) marked the end of a period of internal tranquility and good government. 
  After his death the empire quickly descended 
  into civil war. He has symbolized the Golden Age of the Roman Empire for many generations in the West.

  Five of the main themes in this book are: change, death and the shortness of life; the role and importance of the     rational mind and will; dealing with others and accepting their shortcomings; avoiding the chase for pleasure and     fame; and living according to nature and fully accepting its course.
